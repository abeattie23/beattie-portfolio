## About me - Alice Beattie

I am a Masters candidate in Public Policy and Management, planning to graduate in May 2020.  This website is a response to an Advanced Geographical Information Systems class and will serve as a portfolio of projects, ideas, and works-in-progress using ArcGIS Pro, Google Maps, and other open source or low-cost mapping softwares.

My interests include climate policy, transportation policy, technology in government, gardening, shape note singing, hiking, saying hello to dogs on the street, cooking experiments, and running.

I have some ArcGIS classroom experience and have applied it to transportation equity projects.


## What I hope to learn

In this class I hope to learn best practices for managing geographic data, low cost and free ways to analyze and visualize spatial data, and advanced features of ArcGIS Pro software.

I think spatial visualization and analysis are broadly applicable tools for government and private business, but often organizations are not able to pay for the full license for ArcGIS pro.  Fortunately, in this class we plan to cover lower cost options which shoud be available to organizations and governments with all sizes of budgets!
