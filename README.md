Mapping portfolio for Alice Beattie, CMU 

## About me

I am a Masters candidate in Public Policy and Management, planning to graduate in May 2020.  This website is a response to an Advanced Graphical Information Systems class and will serve as a portfolio of projects, ideas, and works-in-progress using ArcGIS Pro, Google Maps, and other open source or low-cost mapping softwares.

My interests include climate policy, transportation policy, technology in government, gardening, shape note singing, hiking and running.

## What I hope to learn

In this class I hope to learn best practices for managing geographic data, low cost and free ways to analyze and visualize spatial data, and advanced features of ArcGIS Pro software.
